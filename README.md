# Remotely-Heart-Attack-Monitoring

In thos project I have taken raw data from pulse sensor using arduino and by using Rasberry pi the raw data is contineously uploading on firebase cloud then this data is processed to analyse irregularities in heart beat and the system will alert the nearest hospital.
(As the project is currently in progress so any changes in this will reflect here sooner)
